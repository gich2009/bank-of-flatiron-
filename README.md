# Transaction Tracker App

A powerful React-based web application designed for managing and tracking transactions.

## Overview

Transaction Tracker App is a comprehensive tool that enables users to view a table of transactions, add new transactions through a streamlined form, and search for transactions using a robust search bar. 

## Features

- **View Transactions:** The main page displays a comprehensive table of all transactions, with each transaction represented by a row in the table. Each row displays the date, description, category, and amount of the transaction.
- **Add Transactions:** Easily add a new transaction by clicking on the "Add Transaction" button, filling out the form with the transaction's details, and submitting it. The new transaction will be added to the table and saved in the database.
- **Search Transactions:** The built-in search bar allows users to quickly find transactions. The search function is case-insensitive and covers all columns in the table.
